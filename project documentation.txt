1, I want you to arrange the site in such a way that it will be 2 in 1 site, one side will be for God’s Elevating Hands Intl while the other side will be for SUN OPERATIONAL LIGHT INITIATIVE DEVELOPMENT (SOLID) you will make it in such a way that it can have its home page, but the web address should remain the same www.elevatedbygod.com 

SUN OPERATIONAL LIGHT INITIATIVE DEVELOPMENT (SOLID) is a network and solar affiliate and a sole distributor to Kamisafe Solar Energy, Macpower Inverter, Inegy Kodiac and among others.

This is an innovation from God’s E-Hands International and its powered by NEOLIFE & AIM GLOBAL with the sole aim to alleviate poverty, to subsidize the high rate of electricity bills that is unseen & the high rate of solar energy by bringing solar power to the use of the common man in fullness with the aim of reaching everyone with solar power and also to subsidize the price of other bigger network companies.

For the products to get to the masses at affordable rate which you cannot get anywhere, since all fingers are not equal, SOLID SOLAR SYSTEM has decided to make it affordable to every tom, dick & harry in these 3 outlets.
